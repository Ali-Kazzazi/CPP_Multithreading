# Multithreading

<details>

<summary>1. Thread implementation [demo_001.cpp]</summary>

## Overview

This program demonstrates basic multithreading in C++ using the `<thread>` library. It creates two concurrent threads that print messages to the console: the main thread and a spawned worker thread.

## What This Code Does

The program spawns a secondary thread (`t1`) that runs the `func1()` function while the main thread continues its own execution. Both threads attempt to print 100 messages to the console:

- **Thread T1**: Prints `--T1` 100 times
- **Main Thread**: Prints `MAIN--` 100 times

Because both threads write to `std::cout` concurrently, the output will be interleaved in an unpredictable pattern.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. **Thread Creation**
```cpp
std::thread t1(func1);
```
Creates a new thread that immediately begins executing the `func1()` function.

### 2. **Thread Joining**
```cpp
t1.join();
```
The main thread waits for thread `t1` to complete before continuing. This is crucial because:
- A thread object must be either joined or detached before it's destroyed
- Failing to join/detach causes the program to call `std::terminate()`

### 3. **Exception-Safe Thread Management**
The try-catch block ensures that even if an exception occurs in the main thread:
- The spawned thread `t1` is properly joined (cleanup)
- The exception is then re-thrown for proper error handling
- This prevents thread leaks and undefined behavior

## Building and Running

### Compilation
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -pthread demo_001.cpp -o threading_demo
```

### Execution
```bash
./threading_demo
```

## Important Notes

- **Thread Safety**: This code has a race condition. Multiple threads writing to `std::cout` simultaneously can cause garbled output. For production code, use proper synchronization (mutexes) when accessing shared resources.
- **C++11 Required**: The `<thread>` library requires C++11 or later.
- **Compilation Flag**: Use `-pthread` flag when compiling with GCC/Clang to link the threading library.

## Learning Points

This example is ideal for understanding:
- How to create and manage threads in C++
- Why proper thread joining is essential
- The importance of exception-safe thread management
- The concept of concurrent execution and race conditions
